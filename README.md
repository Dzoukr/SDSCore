# .NET Standard 2.0 / .NET Core 3.1 port of Scientific DataSet Lite

This is a .NET Standard 2.0 / .NET Core 3.1 port of amazing [SDSLite](https://github.com/predictionmachines/SDSlite) library for manipulating netCDF, CSV and TSV files.

All credit goes to contributors of the original library, I just did few cleanups and small refactoring regarding reading library paths.

Please see the [original library](https://github.com/predictionmachines/SDSlite) documentation for understanding how to read netCDF files and how to setup necessary dependencies.
